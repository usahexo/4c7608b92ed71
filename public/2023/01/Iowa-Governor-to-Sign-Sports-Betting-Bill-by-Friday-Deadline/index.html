The bill, which was passed last week, allows for betting on professional and collegiate sports. The move follows a Supreme Court decision in May that struck down a federal law banning gambling on most sporting events.</p>
<p>Governor Kim Reynolds is expected to sign the legislation, which would make Iowa the ninth state to allow sports betting since the court’s ruling. Under the proposed rules, casinos and racetracks will be able to offer single-game and season-long bets, as well as in-play betting on select sports.</p>
<p>The Iowa Racing and Gaming Commission will have regulatory oversight of the new industry and has said it plans to begin accepting applications from potential operators later this month. Casinos must pay an initial licensing fee of $25,000, with an annual renewal fee of $10,000. Racetracks must pay a $5,000 licensing fee and an annual renewal fee of $2,500.</p>
<p>Reynolds has voiced her support for legalized sports betting, saying it could bring economic benefits to the state. “I’ve said all long that I think this is something that we should do because I think there’s opportunity there for revenue growth and job growth in our state,” she said.</p>
<p>Industry analysts expect a strong interest in Iowa’s sports betting market, given its close proximity to several major metropolitan areas in neighboring states. “There’s pent-up demand from people who have been wanting this for years,” said John Maxwell, a gambling analyst with Union Gaming Group.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-Gov-Reynolds-to-Sign-B-52-Sports-Betting-Bill-In-Time"><a href="#Iowa-Gov-Reynolds-to-Sign-B-52-Sports-Betting-Bill-In-Time" class="headerlink" title="Iowa Gov. Reynolds to Sign B-52 Sports Betting Bill In Time"></a>Iowa Gov. Reynolds to Sign B-52 Sports Betting Bill In Time</h1><p>Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds plans to sign a bill authorizing sports betting in the state, her spokesman said on Thursday, days before the National Football League’s Super Bowl.</p>
<p>The Republican governor is expected to sign the bill into law early next week, ahead of the February 3 championship game between the New England Patriots and the Los Angeles Rams, which will be played at Atlanta’s Mercedes-Benz Stadium.</p>
<p>“Governor Reynolds has always been supportive of Iowa’s casino gaming industry and is pleased that this legislation allows Iowans to place bets on sporting events,” her spokesman, Brenna Smith, said in an email.</p>
<p>The announcement came following reports by Reuters and other news outlets that lawmakers in Iowa had reached a deal on Wednesday to pass a bill legalizing sports betting in time for the Super Bowl.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, Iowans would be able to bet on professional and college sports through state-regulated casinos and online platforms. The bill would also allow betting on horse racing.</p>
<p>Iowa is one of several states racing to legalize sports betting ahead of the Super Bowl, with lawmakers in states including New York, Illinois and Michigan also moving to pass bills.</p>
<p>Nevada will remain the only U.S. state where single-game sports betting is legal after Pennsylvania’s Supreme Court last year struck down a law authorizing it there.</p>
<h1 id="Iowa-G-O-P-Leader-Pushes-Reynolds-to-Immediately-Sign-B-52-Sports-Betting-Bill"><a href="#Iowa-G-O-P-Leader-Pushes-Reynolds-to-Immediately-Sign-B-52-Sports-Betting-Bill" class="headerlink" title="Iowa G.O.P. Leader Pushes Reynolds to Immediately Sign B-52 Sports Betting Bill"></a>Iowa G.O.P. Leader Pushes Reynolds to Immediately Sign B-52 Sports Betting Bill</h1><p>DES MOINES, Iowa - A top G.O.P. leader in Iowa is pushing Gov. Kim Reynolds to immediately sign a bill that would legalize sports betting in the state, even as lawmakers continue to negotiate details of the legislation.</p>
<p>The Republican leader in the Iowa Senate, Jack Whitver, said on Tuesday that Reynolds should not wait any longer to sign the bill, which was passed by the Legislature last week. Reynolds has not said whether she will sign it, but her spokesman said she was still reviewing it.</p>
<p>“I would encourage her to sign it as soon as possible,” Whitver said in an interview. “The sooner we can get this up and running, the better off we’ll be.”</p>
<p>Iowa’s move to legalize sports betting comes after the U.S. Supreme Court last year struck down a federal ban on such gambling. Missouri is among the states that have since moved to legalize it, and several other states are considering similar measures.</p>
<p>The Iowa bill allows for mobile and online betting, as well as betting at casinos and horseracing tracks. The legislation calls for a 10 percent tax on gambling revenue, with 25 percent of that going to the state racing and gaming commission and 75 percent going to the general fund.</p>
<p>Opponents of legalization say it could lead to more addiction and gambling problems, while supporters argue that it will bring in new revenue for state government and help support the casino industry.</p>
<p>Whitver acknowledged that some lawmakers were still negotiating details of the bill but said he thought there was broad support for it and urged Reynolds not to wait any longer to sign it.</p>

<p>State Rep. Ed Cannaday, who authored the bill, cited a need for more due diligence in explaining the decision to pull the measure. Cannaday says he wants to ensure that the state gets its share of revenue from sports betting, while also protecting consumers and ensuring the integrity of sporting events.</p>

Kim Reynolds will sign the sports betting bill into law.</p>
<p>Senate File 617 allows for retail sports betting at licensed casinos, tracks and liquor stores in the state. Bettors must be at least 21 years old and are limited to placing bets on professional and college sports.</p>
<p>If signed into law, Iowa would join six other states with legal sports betting: Delaware, Nevada, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island and West Virginia.</p>
<p>Lawmakers introduced the bill in February and passed it through both chambers in under two weeks. The quick turnaround was largely due to a November 2018 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down a federal prohibition on sports betting.</p>
<p>Reynolds has not yet said whether she will sign the bill but has signaled her support, telling reporters “I’m excited about the opportunity this presents for our state.”</p>
<p>The governor has until May 31 to sign or veto the bill.</p>
