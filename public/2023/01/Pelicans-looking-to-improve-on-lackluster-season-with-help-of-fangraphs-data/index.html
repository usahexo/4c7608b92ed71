        <h1 id="Pelicans-looking-to-improve-on-lackluster-season-with-help-of-fangraphs-data"><a href="#Pelicans-looking-to-improve-on-lackluster-season-with-help-of-fangraphs-data" class="headerlink" title="Pelicans looking to improve on lackluster season with help of fangraphs data"></a>Pelicans looking to improve on lackluster season with help of fangraphs data</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans had a lackluster season by their standards last year. Coming into the year with high expectations after making it to the second round of the playoffs the year before, they finished the season with a 34-48 record, missing the playoffs altogether. This offseason they took steps to improve their team by signing Julius Randle and Elfrid Payton in free agency.</p>
<p>One area where they could improve is on defense. They were 24th in defensive rating last year according to fangraphs.com. To try and address this, they signed Emeka Okafor, who is a veteran center with a lot of experience on defense. Another thing they could do is try to get more steals. They were 24th in steal percentage last year, so adding players like Payton and Wesley Johnson who are both good at getting steals could help them in this area.</p>
<p>One other area where they could improve is getting to the line more often. They were 23rd in free throw rate last year. Adding players like Randle and Nikola Mirotic who are good at getting to the line could help them in this area as well.</p>
<p>Overall, the Pelicans should be improved this year based on the moves they made this offseason, and using data from fangraphs.com can help them target specific areas where they need to improve in order to be successful.</p>
<h1 id="How-Pelicans-can-use-fangraphs-data-to-their-advantage-in-making-bets"><a href="#How-Pelicans-can-use-fangraphs-data-to-their-advantage-in-making-bets" class="headerlink" title="How Pelicans can use fangraphs data to their advantage in making bets"></a>How Pelicans can use fangraphs data to their advantage in making bets</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans have not fared well in recent years. However, they appear to be turning a corner, with the acquisition of superstar Anthony Davis in the offseason. The addition of Davis, Jrue Holiday, Tyreke Evans and Ryan Anderson gives the Pelicans one of the most talented rosters in the NBA.</p>
<p>Given this talent, it is important for the Pelicans to use all available information in order to make good decisions on who to play and when. One tool that can help them do this is Fangraphs. Fangraphs is a website that tracks data on player performance in various aspects of the game, such as hitting, pitching and fielding. This data can be used by teams to optimize their lineups and strategies.</p>
<p>For example, let’s take a look at two players on the Pelicans – Ryan Anderson and Anthony Davis. According to Fangraphs data, here are their stats for the 2013-14 season:</p>
<p>Player A: .404&#x2F;.816&#x2F;1.059; 10 HR, 26 RBI</p>
<p>Player B: .254&#x2F;.419&#x2F;.752; 3 HR, 9 RBI</p>
<p>Based on these numbers, it would appear that Player A is the better player. However, this data does not take into account that Player A plays in a more difficult ballpark (AT&amp;T Park) than Player B (Kauffman Stadium). When this difference is taken into account, it is clear that Player B is actually the better player. In fact, his stats would be equivalent to .315&#x2F;.536&#x2F;.917 if he played in AT&amp;T Park.</p>
<p>This example shows how important it is for teams to consider all factors when evaluating players. Without Fangraphs data, it is likely that the Pelicans would have made some bad decisions regarding their lineup. With Fangraphs data at their disposal, however, they can now make more informed decisions based on all relevant information.</p>
<h1 id="Taking-a-closer-look-at-how-New-Orleans-Pelicans-can-use-fangraphs-data-for-sports-gambling"><a href="#Taking-a-closer-look-at-how-New-Orleans-Pelicans-can-use-fangraphs-data-for-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Taking a closer look at how New Orleans Pelicans can use fangraphs data for sports gambling"></a>Taking a closer look at how New Orleans Pelicans can use fangraphs data for sports gambling</h1><p>There has been a lot of discussion about how big data can be used for sports gambling in the past few years. This is because there is a huge potential for profits in this area. With the help of fangraphs data, bookmakers and punters can make more accurate predictions.</p>
<p>Fangraphs is a website that offers detailed analytical data for baseball and other sports. This data can be used to determine things like how likely a particular team is to win or lose a particular game. It can also be used to work out which teams are over or undervalued by the bookmakers.</p>
<p>The New Orleans Pelicans are an interesting team to look at using fangraphs data. They had a disappointing season last year, finishing with a 34-48 record. However, they have made some major changes in the offseason and are now considered one of the contenders in the Western Conference.</p>
<p>fangraphs actually values the Pelicans quite highly, rating them as the 8th best team in the NBA. This may come as a surprise to some people, considering their recent record. However, there are several factors that suggest that this rating may be accurate.</p>
<p>First of all, the Pelicans have a very strong starting lineup. Between Anthony Davis, DeMarcus Cousins, Jrue Holiday and Rajon Rondo they have four All-Star caliber players. They also have a number of talented role players who can contribute off the bench.</p>
<p>Another reason to believe in the Pelicans is their strength on offense. They were 4th in the NBA in offensive rating last season and should be even better this year with Cousins and Rondo both being added to the team.</p>
<p>The biggest question marks for New Orleans are on defense and whether they can stay healthy throughout the season. The addition of Cousins certainly helps on defense, but they will still need Holiday and Davis to play at an All-Star level on that end of the court if they want to make it to the playoffs.</p>
<p>All in all, fangraphs data suggests that there is value betting on the New Orleans Pelicans this season. They are definitely not a sure thing by any means, but there is upside betting on them given their current odds at most sportsbooks</p>
<h1 id="Could-New-Orleans-Pelicans’-fangraphs-data-give-them-an-edge-in-sports-gambling"><a href="#Could-New-Orleans-Pelicans’-fangraphs-data-give-them-an-edge-in-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Could New Orleans Pelicans’ fangraphs data give them an edge in sports gambling?"></a>Could New Orleans Pelicans’ fangraphs data give them an edge in sports gambling?</h1><p>New Orleans Pelicans’ fangraphs data is a valuable tool for sports gambling, because it can help to identify potential mismatches and tendencies that may give one team an edge over the other.</p>
<p>Fangraphs data includes metrics like batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage for hitters; and Earned Run Average (ERA), Fielding Independent Pitching (FIP), and Defense-Independent Pitching (DIP) for pitchers. These metrics can be used to measure a player’s individual contribution to their team’s success.</p>
<p>For example, if a gambler was looking to bet on the Cleveland Indians in a game against the Detroit Tigers, they could use Fangraphs data to see that Indians’ shortstop Francisco Lindor has been having an especially good season. Lindor’s batting average, on-base percentage, and slugging percentage would all be above-average compared to players at other positions, indicating that he is having a strong season. The gambler could then bet on the Indians to win based on this information.</p>
<p>Alternatively, if the gambler was looking to bet on the Detroit Tigers in this same game, they could use Fangraphs data to see that Tigers’ pitcher Michael Fulmer has had a really good season. Fulmer’s ERA and FIP would both be below-average compared to pitchers at other positions, indicating that he may be less likely than most pitchers to get the win in this game. The gambler could then bet on the Tigers to lose based on this information.</p>
<p>While no tool can guarantee success when gambling on sports, using Fangraphs data can give you a good idea of which teams and players are performing well right now and how those performances might translate into wins or losses.</p>
<h1 id="New-Orleans-Pelicans-relying-on-fangraphs-data-to-help-with-sports-gambling"><a href="#New-Orleans-Pelicans-relying-on-fangraphs-data-to-help-with-sports-gambling" class="headerlink" title="New Orleans Pelicans relying on fangraphs data to help with sports gambling"></a>New Orleans Pelicans relying on fangraphs data to help with sports gambling</h1><p>The New Orleans Pelicans are one of the most exciting teams in the NBA. Led by superstar Anthony Davis, the Pelicans are always a threat to make a deep playoff run.</p>
<p>While most of the focus this season has been on Davis and his MVP-caliber play, the Pelicans have quietly been putting together a very good season. They currently sit in 5th place in the Western Conference, just 4 games behind first place.</p>
<p>A big reason for their success has been their reliance on fangraphs data. Fangraphs is a website that specializes in sports analytics and provides detailed data on player performance and team stats.</p>
<p>The Pelicans have been using fangraphs data to help with sports gambling. They have found that by analyzing player stats and tendencies, they can better predict how games will unfold. This information has helped them to make some intelligent bets this season.</p>
<p>One area where the Pelicans have benefited from fangraphs data is in offensive efficiency. By analyzing which players are most effective when shooting from certain spots on the floor, they have been able to create shots that are more likely to result in points. This has helped them score more points per game than their opponents this season.</p>
<p>The Pelicans also use fangraphs data to study defense. By tracking which players are most effective at guarding certain players or positions, they can put together a game plan that limits their opponents’ scoring opportunities.</p>
<p>Overall, the Pelicans have been very successful this season thanks in part to their reliance on fangraphs data. With the playoffs just around the corner, it will be interesting to see if they can continue to win games by using analytics instead of instinct alone.</p>
