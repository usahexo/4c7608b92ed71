<p>With a convincing 11-1 victory over the Baltimore Orioles on Tuesday night, the Boston Red Sox clinched their ninth consecutive American League East Division Championship. This is the third-longest streak in league history, trailing only the Yankees (14) and Braves (10).</p>
<p>Boston has been dominant in the division throughout this streak, finishing with a winning record in every year. Their current lead of 8.5 games is the largest they’ve had at any point during the streak. The team has also been successful in the playoffs, winning three World Series titles (2004, 2007, 2013) and appearing in two other World Series (2008, 2016).</p>
<p>The success of this team can be attributed to a number of factors. The most important may be their strong starting pitching. Led by Chris Sale and David Price, the rotation has been one of the best in baseball over the past few years. The bullpen has also been solid, with Craig Kimbrel anchoring the back end.</p>
<p>Offensively, Mookie Betts has emerged as one of the best players in baseball. He leads the team in batting average (.322), home runs (32), and RBIs (107). Other key contributors include J.D. Martinez (38 HRs, 108 RBIs), Xander Bogaerts (21 HRs, 103 RBIs), and Andrew Benintendi (20 HRs, 82 RBIs).</p>
<p>Manager Alex Cora has done an excellent job leading this team to success. He was able to get the most out of his players and keep them focused throughout the season.</p>
<p>The Red Sox will look to continue their success in the playoffs and win another World Series title.</p>
<h1 id="Yankees-Miss-Playoffs-for-Second-Straight-Year"><a href="#Yankees-Miss-Playoffs-for-Second-Straight-Year" class="headerlink" title="Yankees Miss Playoffs for Second Straight Year"></a>Yankees Miss Playoffs for Second Straight Year</h1><p>The Yankees had high hopes for the 2018 season,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> but they came up short once again and failed to make the playoffs. This is the second straight year that they have missed the playoffs, and it could be a sign that they are in decline.</p>
<p>The Yankees have some good young players, but they are still struggling to compete with the best teams in the league. They need to make some major improvements if they want to make a return to the playoffs in 2019.</p>
<p> Yankee fans were disappointed with their team’s performance this year, but there is still hope for the future. The Yankees have a talented roster and they should be able to contend for a playoff spot next year.</p>
<h1 id="Tampa-Bay-Rays-in-First-Since-2011"><a href="#Tampa-Bay-Rays-in-First-Since-2011" class="headerlink" title="Tampa Bay Rays in First Since 2011"></a>Tampa Bay Rays in First Since 2011</h1><p>The Tampa Bay Rays sit atop of the American League East standings as of Monday, April 16th. This is their first time in first place since the end of the 2011 season. The Rays are coming off a 2017 season where they finished last in the division.</p>
<p>The offseason was busy for the Rays. They traded starting pitcher Chris Archer to the Pittsburgh Pirates and also traded outfielder Denard Span to Seattle Mariners. They acquired outfielder Carlos Gomez from Texas Rangers and catcher Wilson Ramos from Philadelphia Phillies.</p>
<p>The Rays have gotten strong performances from their starting pitchers this season. Blake Snell has been their best pitcher so far with a 2-1 record and 1.84 ERA. He was named AL Pitcher of the Month for March&#x2F;April. Other starting pitchers that have performed well include Tyler Glasnow (2-0, 1.13 ERA), Jake Faria (2-1, 3.07 ERA), and Yonny Chirinos (1-0, 2.35 ERA).</p>
<p>Offensively, they are led by Evan Longoria and his .348 batting average. Other hitters that are off to good starts include Gomez (.324 batting average) and Ramos (.316 batting average).</p>
<p>The Rays will face a tough test in their next series as they will face the Boston Red Sox, who are currently in first place in the AL East standings.</p>
<h1 id="Baltimore-Orioles-End-Season-with-Worst-Record-in-Baseball"><a href="#Baltimore-Orioles-End-Season-with-Worst-Record-in-Baseball" class="headerlink" title="Baltimore Orioles End Season with Worst Record in Baseball"></a>Baltimore Orioles End Season with Worst Record in Baseball</h1><p>The Baltimore Orioles finished their season with the worst record in all of baseball. This was a huge disappointment for a team that had such high expectations coming into the year.</p>
<p>Baltimore’s struggles began early in the season, as they struggled to win games against even the weakest of opponents. Their pitching staff was atrocious, and their offense was inconsistent at best.</p>
<p>Things only got worse as the season went on, as the team continued to lose games and fell further and further out of playoff contention. In the end, they finished with a record of 47-115, which is easily the worst in all of baseball.</p>
<p>This disappointing season likely means that there will be some major changes in Baltimore this offseason. The team has already started to trade away some of their veteran players, and it’s likely that more moves will be made in order to rebuild the roster from scratch.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to see how things play out for the Orioles over the next few years. They clearly have a lot of work to do in order to become competitive again. In the meantime, they can only hope to improve on their dismal record from this past season.</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Blue-Jays-Post-Worst-Record-in-North-American-Sports"><a href="#Toronto-Blue-Jays-Post-Worst-Record-in-North-American-Sports" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Blue Jays Post Worst Record in North American Sports"></a>Toronto Blue Jays Post Worst Record in North American Sports</h1><p>The Toronto Blue Jays have finished the 2017 season with the worst record of any team in North America. At 69-93, they finish 28 games back of the AL East Champion Boston Red Sox and 29 games out of a Wild Card spot. This was a disappointing season for the Blue Jays, who were expected to contend after making several big moves in the offseason.</p>
<p>The offseason began with much speculation about whether or not the Blue Jays would trade reigning MVP Josh Donaldson. They decided to keep him, but traded Jose Bautista and Edwin Encarnacion, two fan favorites. The Blue Jays also signed Kendrys Morales, who had been recently released by the Kansas City Royals.</p>
<p>Toronto got off to a poor start, going just 22-29 in their first 51 games. Injuries played a role in their struggles, as Donaldson, Troy Tulowitzki, J.A. Happ, and Aaron Loup all spent time on the disabled list. The Blue Jays did not play much better after their key players returned from injury, finishing 47-64 over the rest of the season.</p>
<p>Despite their poor play, there were some positives for Toronto this season. Morales led the team in home runs (38) and RBIs (85), while Marco Estrada had another strong year on the mound, posting a 3.48 ERA in 33 starts. Roberto Osuna continued to be one of MLB’s best closers, recording 39 saves while striking out 92 batters in 73 innings pitched.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to 2018, the Blue Jays will have some decisions to make regarding their roster. Donaldson is set to become a free agent at the end of next season and is likely to command a high salary on the open market. Toronto will also need to find a replacement for Bautista in right field; Kevin Pillar could be a candidate for that role if he can improve his batting average (.255 in 2017).</p>
<p>Despite their disappointing season, there is still some talent on the Toronto roster and they should be contenders for a playoff spot in 2018.</p>
