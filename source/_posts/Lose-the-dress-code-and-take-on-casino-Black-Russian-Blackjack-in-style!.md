#  Lose the dress code and take on casino Black Russian Blackjack in style!

Casino Black Russian Blackjack is one of the most popular casino card games and is played with a standard 52-card deck. The aim of the game is to beat the dealer by either getting 21 points on your first two cards (a blackjack), or by taking more points than the dealer without going bust.

While there are many different variants of blackjack, casino Black Russian Blackjack is probably the most popular. In this version, players are dealt two cards face up and one card face down. The face down card is called the “hole card”. The aim is to get as close to 21 as possible, without going over.

If you get 21 points with your first two cards (a blackjack), you win instantly! If not, you can continue playing by taking another card (hit) or standing with the total that you have. If you go over 21, you bust and lose automatically.

The dealer also draws cards until they reach 17 and must stand on any total of 17 or more. The player always goes first, and the game progresses clockwise around the table.

In casino Black Russian Blackjack, players can split their hand if they are dealt two cards of the same rank. This means that they will then be dealt another card for each hand and can play each hand independently. Doubling down is also allowed – this means that you can double your bet after being dealt your first two cards, but you can only receive one more card for each hand.

When it comes to betting, players can bet on whether they will win or lose (even/odd), or choose a specific number of points between 1 and 11 which they think their final total will be (e.g., 7). There are many other bets that can be made in casino Black Russian Blackjack, but these are the most common ones.
