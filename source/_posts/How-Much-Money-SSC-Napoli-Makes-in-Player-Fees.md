#  How Much Money SSC Napoli Makes in Player Fees

After being crowned champions of Serie A for the 8th time, Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis revealed how much money the club had made from player sales in the past year. The total amounted to a staggering €191 million, with new signings Arkadiusz Milik and Lorenzo Insigne's arrivals accounting for €42 million of that. The astronomical figure puts Napoli on a par with some of Europe's biggest clubs in terms of player trading income.

Much of this money has come in recent years, as the club has become a regular Champions League participant. In 2013, Gonzalo Higuain's move to Real Madrid netted €37 million, while Edinson Cavani's sale to Paris Saint-Germain in 2013 brought in a whopping €64 million. With UEFA's Financial Fair Play regulations coming into play, however, it is likely that Napoli will have to be more creative when it comes to bringing in revenue from player sales in future.

De Laurentiis recently announced that he was looking to sell the club, although he later retracted his statement and said he was only looking for investors. Whether or not this lofty player fee income is a major selling point is yet to be seen.

#  How Much Money SSC Napoli Makes in Jersey Sales

After a long season in Serie A, SSC Napoli has once again qualified for the Champions League. But with money at an all-time high in professional soccer, will they be able to keep up with some of Europe's top clubs?

According to The Richest, SSC Napoli made a total of $126 million in revenue in 2016. Of that, only $11 million came from broadcasting rights. The bulk of their revenue came from matchday income ($56 million) and commercial deals ($59 million).

Interestingly, Jersey sales play a big role in their commercial deals. In fact, Forza Football claims that Napoli made more money from jersey sales than any other Serie A club in 2016. And with Champions League qualification comes greater exposure - which should lead to even more jersey sales.

So how much money do they make from jersey sales? Unfortunately, there is no straightforward answer. Different sources give different numbers. But according to Soccer Bible, Napoli likely earns around $4 million per year from jersey sales. This number is confirmed by Forbes, who state that Napoli earned $4 million from kit sponsors Nike in 2016.

This number may seem small when compared to the likes of Manchester United and Real Madrid, who generate over $50 million annually in jersey sales. But it's important to remember that Napoli is a much smaller club with a limited global reach. And as they continue to progress in the Champions League, their jersey sales will only increase.

#  How Much Money SSC Napoli Makes in Sponsorship Deals

Since the club’s establishment in 1926, SSC Napoli has always been financially stable. The revenues generated from their sponsorship deals are a big contributor to this stability.

SSC Napoli currently has sponsorship deals with two major brands: Nike and Hyundai. Together, these deals are worth approximately €23 million per year. This is a significant amount of money, especially when compared to some of Napoli’s Serie A rivals. For example, Juventus FC’s sponsorship deals are worth a total of €30 million per year, while AS Roma’s sponsorship deals are worth €15 million per year.

Given the size of these sponsorship deals, it is clear that both Nike and Hyundai are happy with their partnership with SSC Napoli. In fact, Nike has stated that they are “thrilled” to continue their partnership with the club. Similarly, Hyundai has described SSC Napoli as a “valued partner”.

The high value of these sponsorship deals is also indicative of the club’s stature in world football. SSC Napoli is a well-known and respected team, which means that companies are willing to pay big money to have their brands associated with the club.

It is predicted that SSC Napoli’s sponsorship deals will continue to increase in value in future years. This is due to the club’s continued success on the pitch, as well as its growing global fanbase. As more and more people become aware of SSC Napoli, companies will be eager to partner with them in order to boost their own brand exposure.

Overall, SSC Napoli’s sponsorship deals are an important source of revenue for the club. They help to ensure that Napoli remains financially stable and can continue to compete at the highest level of European football.

#  How Much Money SSC Napoli Makes from Ticket Sales 

Since the club’s inception in 1926, SSC Napoli has been a mainstay in Serie A. The Naples-based team has won two Italian Championships and one UEFA Cup. In addition to their on-the-field success, SSC Napoli is also one of the most popular clubs in Italy, with average attendance numbers that often rank among the top 5 in the league.

While ticket prices vary based on opponent and seating location, the average ticket price for an SSC Napoli home match ranges from €25 to €50. Given the team’s large fan base and consistent success, it’s not surprising that SSC Napoli brings in a significant amount of revenue from ticket sales alone.

According to recent estimates, SSC Napoli generates around €10 million per season from ticket sales. This accounts for roughly 10% of the club’s total revenue and makes them one of the most profitable clubs in Serie A when it comes to gate receipts.

While this number may seem small compared to teams like Manchester United or Real Madrid, it’s important to remember that Serie A is a much smaller league with far fewer matches than England’s Premier League or Spain’s La Liga. In fact, SSC Napoli ranked 4th out of 20 clubs in Serie A last season when it comes to total revenue generated from ticket sales.

Despite this ranking, it’s clear that SSC Napoli is still able to generate a healthy amount of income from ticket sales alone. And with new stadium renovations set to be completed in time for the 2016/2017 season, it's likely that this number will continue to grow in years to come.

SSC Napoli has been a strong contender in the Italian Serie A for many years. The club’s fans are some of the most passionate in all of Europe, and the team is known for its exciting, attacking style of play.

One of the key reasons for the team’s success is its lucrative television rights deals. In this article, we will take a closer look at how much money SSC Napoli makes from television rights and how this money is distributed among the different stakeholders.

The current deal between SSC Napoli and Sky Italia expires in 2020. The two parties have been in negotiations over a new deal, but no agreement has yet been reached. Let’s take a look at how much money SSC Napoli made from television rights in the past and what their current demands are.

In 2016-17, SSC Napoli earned €58 million from television rights deals. Of this amount, €47 million was paid by Sky Italia. This was by far the largest broadcasting deal in Serie A that season.

AC Milan was second with €31 million, while Juventus earned €27 million. This is a testament to the growing popularity of SSC Napoli both in Italy and around the world.

SSC Napoli is currently asking for a raise to €70 million per season as part of their new TV rights deal with Sky Italia. This would put them on par with Juventus and AC Milan, who both earn €70 million per season from television rights deals.

It will be interesting to see whether SSC Napoli can get their desired raise or if they will have to settle for less. No matter what happens, it is clear that the club’s impressive performances on the pitch have allowed them to generate significant revenue from television rights deals.
