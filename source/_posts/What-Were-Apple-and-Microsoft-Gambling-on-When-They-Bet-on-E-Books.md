#  What Were Apple and Microsoft Gambling on When They Bet on E-Books?

It's been six years since Apple and Microsoft made a joint venture investment in a then-fledgling e-reader company, called Plastic Logic. At the time, many observers were scratching their heads over what the two tech giants could be thinking. After all, Amazon had already established itself as the dominant player in the e-book market with its Kindle reader.

So what exactly were Apple and Microsoft gambling on when they bet on e-books?

For starters, both companies likely saw the potential for growth in the e-book market. E-books had been around for a few years at that point, but they were still relatively new and there was room for expansion. In addition, both Apple and Microsoft were keen to establish themselves as leaders in digital reading technology.

Another factor that may have played into their decision was the emergence of tablet devices like the iPad and the Surface. Both Apple and Microsoft recognized that tablets could potentially cannibalize sales of traditional laptops and desktops, so they wanted to make sure they had a foothold in the e-book market as well.

Ultimately, it looks like both Apple and Microsoft made a wise investment when they bet on e-books. The e-book market has continued to grow over the past six years, and tablets have become incredibly popular devices. It's likely that both Apple and Microsoft are happy with their decision to invest in Plastic Logic back in 2010.

#  What Happened When Apple and Microsoft Gave Up on E-Books?

In the early days of e-books, Microsoft and Apple were the major players. But in 2015, they both gave up their e-book businesses. What happened?

At first, it seemed like a good idea. E-books were a way to make reading more convenient and accessible. They could be read on phones, computers, and other devices. And they were less expensive than traditional books.

Apple was one of the first companies to enter the e-book market. In 2010, it launched the iBookstore, which sold electronic books, audiobooks, and magazines. The next year, Microsoft entered the market with its own e-book store, called MSN Books.

The two companies competed against each other for customers. Apple offered lower prices and more features. Microsoft tried to compete by offering free e-books with its Windows Phones. But it wasn't enough, and in 2015 both companies abandoned their e-book businesses.

What caused their downfall? There are several reasons:

First, there was a change in consumer behavior. People started reading books on smartphones and other devices instead of laptops and desktops. This made it harder for Microsoft and Apple to compete with Amazon, which had a head start in the e-book market.

Second, the rise of self-publishing made it harder for big companies to dominate the market. Authors could now publish their own books without going through a publisher. This gave indie authors a larger share of the market share.

Third, Amazon developed its own Kindle device and became the dominant player in the e-book market. Kindle devices were easy to use and had a large selection of books available for purchase or download. As a result, Amazon gained a majority of the market share for e-books.

Microsoft and Apple both realized that they couldn't compete with Amazon's dominance in the e-book market. So they decided to abandon their e-book businesses and focus on other areas

#  What Do Apple and Microsoft Have in Common When it Comes to E-Books?

Apple and Microsoft have something in common when it comes to e-books - they both want to make money off them.

For publishers, this means that they need to consider which platform they want to publish their e-books on. Apple has been known to be more stringent about the type of books that can be published on its platform, while Microsoft has been more open.

This is an important decision for publishers because it can impact how many people read their books. Apple has a much larger user base than Microsoft, so publishing on its platform could lead to more people reading your book.

However, it's important to note that Apple has been known to take a larger share of the profits from sales on its platform. Microsoft also offers some unique features for e-book publishers, such as the ability to include interactive elements in your book.

In the end, it's up to the publisher to decide which platform is best for them. They need to consider how much they want to pay for hosting their book, how many people they think will read it, and the type of book that they're publishing.

#  Why Did Apple and Microsoft Gamble on E-Books?

Apple and Microsoft’s recently revealed e-book projects may seem puzzling at first- Why would two of the most successful tech companies in the world bother with e-books when there are already so many players in that space? But upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that these companies are not just entering the e-book fray to battle Amazon- They’re staking a claim in a whole new digital content market that is growing rapidly.

The reason for this is that books, like all other forms of digital content, are becoming increasingly important sources of revenue for technology companies. As more and more people move away from traditional forms of entertainment like cable TV and movies, they are turning to their devices for entertainment and information. This has led to a surge in the sale of digital content, including books, music, movies, and TV shows.

In fact, according to a recent report by Forrester Research, the global market for digital content will grow from $144 billion in 2015 to $236 billion by 2020. This represents an annual growth rate of 10.1%, making it one of the fastest growing sectors in the tech industry. So it’s no wonder that Apple and Microsoft are both looking to get a piece of the action.

Apple was one of the pioneers of the digital content market with its iTunes store, which launched over a decade ago. The iTunes store offers music, movies, TV shows, and books for purchase or rental, and has become one of the largest sources of revenue for Apple. In fiscal year 2016, Apple’s services business (which includes iTunes) generated over $24 billion in revenue, up 12% from the previous year.

Microsoft has been slower to enter the digital content market, but it is now making up for lost time. In March 2017, Microsoft announced plans to acquire LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. LinkedIn is not just a professional networking site- It is also a major player in the world of digital publishing. LinkedIn owns Pulse Publishing Inc., which operates a platform where professionals can share articles on business and other topics.

So why did Apple and Microsoft choose e-books as their battleground? E-books have several advantages over other types of digital content. For starters, they are relatively small files and can be accessed quickly and easily on mobile devices. This makes them perfect for reading on the go. E-books also tend to be cheaper than books printed on paper, and many publishers offer them as free downloads with purchase of the printed book.

Finally, e-books can be used to promote other products and services offered by technology companies. For example, Apple often bundles free e-books with its devices such as the iPhone and iPad. And Microsoft is using LinkedIn not just to sell subscriptions to its professional networking service but also to sell subscriptions to its forthcoming online magazine called “Surface”.

So while Apple and Microsoft may not be able to match Amazon’s dominance in the e-book market, they both have plenty to gain by entering it. And with growth rates for digital content expected to remain high over the next few years, there’s still plenty of opportunity for them to capture a bigger share of this lucrative market

#  What Are the Lessons Learned from Apple and Microsoft's Gamble on E-Books?

In 2010, Apple and Microsoft made a bold gamble on the future of e-books. Both companies invested heavily in digital bookstores, expecting to make a fortune as e-book sales took off. However, in the end, both companies lost out on the bet. What went wrong, and what can other businesses learn from their mistakes?

To start with, it's worth looking at why e-books were seen as such a promising market. At the time, they were seen as a way to solve two major problems: piracy and battery life. E-books could be downloaded quickly and easily, without the need for a physical copy. They also don't use up any precious battery life on devices like laptops and smartphones.

Apple was the first company to really capitalize on these advantages. In 2007, they released the iPhone, which became an instant hit thanks to its combination of features and design. The iPhone's success led Apple to focus on creating other innovative products, including the iPad in 2010. The iPad was seen as a game changer in the world of tablets, thanks to its large screen and powerful processing capabilities.

Microsoft was slower to react to the rise of mobile devices. In fact, they didn't even have a credible tablet option until 2012, when they released the Surface Pro. However, by this time Apple had already built up a significant lead in the market.

Both companies saw e-books as a way to boost their sales in this increasingly competitive market. In 2010, they both launched their own digital bookstores - Apple iBooks and Microsoft Store Books. These stores offered customers a selection of books that could be read on their devices with minimal formatting issues.

At first, it seemed like both companies had made a wise move. E-book sales took off rapidly, with revenues reaching $2 billion by 2012 . However, this initial growth was short-lived . By 2015 , sales had plateaued and showed no signs of increasing further .

So what went wrong? There are several reasons for this decline . One is that piracy became increasingly easy with digital files . Customers could easily download books for free without paying for them . This put pressure on publishers , who were already struggling to make money from e-books .

Another reason is that people simply prefer physical books over digital ones . According to one study , 64% of people said they prefer reading physical books , while only 28% said they preferred reading e-books . This is likely due to the lack of tangible benefits that come with reading e-books - there's no sense of progress when you're reading an electronic book , unlike with physical ones where you can see how far you've progressed through them .

Finally , there's the issue of battery life . Tablet batteries tend not to last very long if you're using them for intensive activities like reading books . This means that people are often reluctant to read e-books for extended periods of time , preferring instead to stick to physical books when possible .

Despite these problems , there are still some advantages associated with e-books . They're cheaper than physical books , for example , which makes them attractive for budget-conscious consumers . They're also more environmentally friendly than physical books - each electron used in an ebook results in 65% less greenhouse gas emissions than when paper is used instead .
