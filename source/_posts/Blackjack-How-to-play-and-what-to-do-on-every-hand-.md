# Blackjack: How to play and what to do on every hand 

One of the most popular casino games is blackjack. Played with a deck of cards, blackjack pits player against dealer in a contest to see who can get closest to 21 without going over.

To play blackjack, each player is dealt two cards face up and the dealer is given one card face up and one card face down. The player then decides whether to hit (take another card) or stand (end their turn). After all players have either stood or hit, the dealer reveals their second card and completes their hand. If the dealer's hand total is 16 or less, they must hit; if the dealer has 17 or more, they must stand. The object of the game is for the player's hand total to be higher than the dealer's without going over 21.

If both the player and dealer have identical hands (a "push"), no money changes hands and the round is considered a tie.

Here are some basic tips for playing blackjack:

-Hit on any hand total of less than 17.
-Stand on any hand total of 17 or more. 
-If you have an Ace and a 10 or picture card, hit - you have a natural (blackjack). 
-If you have two cards of equal value (such as two Jacks), hit - this gives you a better chance of getting another card that will push your total over 21. 
-If the dealer shows an Ace as their upcard, take Insurance (see below). 
-Remember that doubling down allows you to double your bet but only receive one more card. 
-In general, always make sure to max out your bets when doubling down - this way you'll win twice as much if you're successful. 
-Splitting pairs allows you to split your original bet into two separate bets, and then play each hand as if it were its own individual game. You can also split Aces, but only receive one more card per Ace. 
Insurance

When the dealer has an Ace showing as their upcard, they offer insurance to players. This is a side bet where players can bet an amount equal to half their original bet that the dealer has Blackjack (an Ace and a 10 or picture card). If the dealer does indeed have Blackjack, then players who placed the insurance bet win 2:1 on their investment - effectively making insurance a winning proposition provided the house edge is not too large. However, if the dealer does not have Blackjack, then players who took insurance lose money just like any other wager in blackjack. For this reason it's important to only take insurance when you feel very confident about the Dealer having Blackjack - otherwise it's simply not worth it.

# Master the art of blackjack with these easy tips 

If you're looking to add some excitement to your casino experience, look no further than blackjack. This classic card game can be easy to learn but provides plenty of opportunity for strategy and skill. Here are a few tips to help you get started.

The basic goal of blackjack is to beat the dealer's hand total without going over 21. Unlike poker, where you are trying to make the best five-card hand, in blackjack each card is worth its face value. The ace can be worth 1 or 11, whichever benefits your hand the most.

The first step to winning at blackjack is to familiarize yourself with the different hands. You'll want to make sure you know when you have a pat hand (one that doesn't need any more cards), when you should hit (take another card), when you should stand (stop taking cards), and when you should double down or split your cards.

One of the most important things to remember is that it's better to stay under 21 than go over. If your hand total exceeds 21, you "bust" and automatically lose no matter what the dealer has. So even if you have a strong hand, it's often wise to stand if you think there's a good chance the dealer will bust as well.

Another key element of blackjack strategy is knowing when to hit and when to stand on soft hands. A soft hand is defined as a hand with an ace, which can be counted as 1 or 11 points. Normally you would hit on any combination totaling less than 17, but with a soft hand you would want to hit if the total is less than 12. For example, if you were dealt an 8 and an Ace, your total would be 9 (eight plus one equals nine) so you would hit in this situation.

One final note: In some casinos, the dealer must hit on 16 or less and stand on 17 or higher. So bear this in mind when playing, especially if the casino you're in has different rules than the ones we've outlined here.

# How to win at blackjack: Tips for each hand 

Blackjack is a casino game that is easy to understand but difficult to master. Players are dealt two cards and must then choose whether to hit, stand, double down, split, or surrender. The goal is to accumulate as close to 21 points as possible without going bust.

With a little practice, anyone can become a blackjack winner. In this article, we will offer tips for each hand to help you increase your chances of winning.

When starting out, it's important to know the basic rules of blackjack. Familiarize yourself with the different situations that can arise and the best course of action to take in each scenario. For example, if you have an Ace and a six (16 points), you should hit unless the dealer has an Ace up (in which case you should stand).

The basic strategy chart below can help you make the right decision in any situation:

In general, you want to avoid taking risks if you're not confident about your odds of winning. For instance, it's usually not advisable to split 10s if the dealer is showing a card valued at 6 or less; the chances of drawing another ten are low, and you're better off holding on to your 10s in case the dealer busts.

If you are unsure about what action to take, always ask the dealer for advice. He or she will be happy to help!

Now that we've gone over some basic tips, let's take a look at some specific hands and how to play them correctly: 

One of the most important hands in blackjack is when you have an Ace and a 10 value card (also known as a "blackjack"). In this situation, you should always stand as it's very difficult for the dealer to beat you with just two cards. 



 Doubling down is another strategic move that can help improve your odds of winning. When doubling down, you are essentially betting twice your original bet amount on one hand. This move is most beneficial when your first two cards total 11 or 12 points. 



 If you are dealt two similar cards (e.g., two 8s), you can split them into two separate hands by placing another bet equal to your original bet amount beside your first bet. Now, each hand will be played separately and the goal is still to achieve 21 points total or closer without going bust. 



 If the dealer has an Ace up (or any other 10 value card), you should always hit if you have 16 or less points total displayed on your cards â€“ even if it means going over 21 points! This move increases your chances of not going bust while also giving yourself a chance to beat the dealer's hand outright..

# 12 essential blackjack tips for each hand 

In any casino game, the house always has an advantage. This is no different in blackjack where the house's edge ranges from around 0.5% to about 1%. However, this doesn't mean you can't win at blackjack - far from it! 

If you want to make the most of your chances of winning when playing blackjack, here are 12 essential tips for each hand: 

1) If you have a 10 and the dealer has a 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 showing, hit.

2) If you have a 12 and the dealer has a 2, 3 or 4 showing, hit.

3) If you have a 13 and the dealer has a 3 or 4 showing, hit.

4) If you have a 16 and the dealer has a 5 or 6 showing, stand.

5) If you have an Ace and a 5, 6 or 7, hit. 
6) If you have an Ace and an 8 or 9, double down. 
7) If the dealer shows an Ace as their up card, insure your bet by placing an additional wager equal to half your original bet. 
8) If the dealer's up card is a 10 or face card, stand. 
9) If you have two cards of the same rank (e.g. two sixes), split them and play two separate hands. 10) Take insurance when offered (even if it means sacrificing part of your potential winnings).  11) Always remember that blackjack is a game of probabilities - sometimes you'll win even when following sound strategy, while other times you'll lose despite making perfect choices. 12) Finally, be patient and stay focused while playing - this will give you the best chance of winning in the long run!

# Strategy for blackjack: Winning tips for each hand

There are a variety of different blackjack strategies that can be used in order to win at the game. However, it is important to first understand how the game works and the different hands that can be played.

The object of blackjack is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. The player is dealt two cards and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. The player then has the option to hit (take another card) or stand (end the turn). If the player busts (goes over 21), they lose regardless of what the dealer has. If the dealer has a higher total than the player, the dealer wins. If the totals are equal, it is a push and neither player nor dealer wins.

There are a number of different blackjack strategies that can be used, but here are some tips for each hand:

-If you have an Ace and a 10 or face card, hit. This gives you a total of 21 and almost always wins against the dealer's total of 17 or less.

-If you have two 3s, hit. This gives you a total of 6 and is likely to lose against most other totals except 16 or below.

-If you have an Ace and a 2, hit if the dealer's card is 6 or less else stand. With an Ace and 2, your total will be 3 which beats most dealers' totals when they draw another card.
