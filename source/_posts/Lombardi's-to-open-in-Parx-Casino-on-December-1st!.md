#  Lombardi's to open in Parx Casino on December 1st!

Lombardi's, one of the most iconic and well-known pizza places in New York City, will open a location at Parx Casino in Bensalem, Pennsylvania on December 1st. The new casino location will be Lombardi's first outside of New York, and is part of an effort by Parx Casino to expand its food offerings.

Lombardi's has been serving up some of the best pizza in town since 1905, when it was opened as a small bakery by Gennaro Lombardi. The pizzeria has seen several iterations over the years, but has always been known for its classic Italian-American pies. In addition to pizza, Lombardi's also offers calzones, stromboli, and other Italian favorites.

The Parx Casino location will offer a slightly expanded menu compared to the New York City restaurants, with a focus on catering to local tastes. The menu will include unique items like Philly cheese steak pizza and crab cake pizzas. There will also be a wide variety of gluten-free and vegan options available.

The Parx Casino location is expected to be a major tourist attraction due to Lombardi's well-known reputation. It is also expected to be popular with locals, who will now have a convenient option for getting their hands on some of the best pizza in town.

Lombardi's founder and owner, Joe Lombardi, is excited about the new venture. "We are thrilled to bring our brick oven pizzas to Parx Casino," he said. "The casino has a great reputation and we know our pizzas will be a big hit with guests."

The Parx Casino management team is equally excited about the addition of Lombardi's.
