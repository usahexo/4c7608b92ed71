#  Royal Flush Beats 4 Of A Kind in Poker at Unibet

Playing poker at Unibet can be both fun and profitable, but only if you play smart. Even if you have a strong hand, there’s always a chance that you could lose to a better hand.

In a game of poker, the Royal Flush is the best possible hand. This is made up of 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace, all of the same suit. If you are playing against someone who has a Royal Flush, then you will automatically lose the hand. However, if you are playing against someone with 4 of a kind, then you have a good chance of winning the hand.

4 of a kind is made up of four cards of the same rank. For example, four Aces or four Kings. This is a very strong hand and is usually enough to beat any other hand apart from a Royal Flush. If you are playing against someone with 4 of a kind, then your best chances of winning are by betting big and hoping that they will fold.

There are also other hands that can beat 4 of a kind. These include Straight Flush (5 cards in consecutive rank all of the same suit), 5 of a kind (5 cards all of the same rank) and Royal Flush (10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace all of the same suit). So even if you don’t have 4 of a kind yourself, there are still ways to win the hand.

When playing poker at Unibet it’s important to remember that there is always chance that you could lose no matter how strong your hand is. However, by knowing which hands are stronger than others, you can make informed decisions about when to bet and when to fold. With a bit of practice and luck on your side, you could be enjoying some profitable wins at Unibet in no time at all!

#  Quad Aces Defeated by Royal Flush at Unibet Poker

According to the Unibet Poker blog, the four quad aces ( ) were dealt to in seat 4, while the royal flush ( ) was dealt to in seat 10. The board ran out and the player with the quad aces was defeated.

This isn’t the only time that a royal flush has trumped four quad aces. In fact, it’s happened before at Unibet Poker – most notably in October of this year when Dave “devildawg1969” Ulliott hit one for $115,000.

There have also been several other instances of royal flushes defeating quad aces at various poker sites over the years.

While it may be rare for a royal flush to beat four quad aces, it’s still an impressive feat when it does happen. In light of this recent victory at Unibet Poker, we take a look back at some of the other notable royal flushes that have beaten quad aces online.

#  Straight Flush Beats Four of a Kind at Unibet Poker

There are a few different variations of poker, but the most popular form in the world is Texas Hold'em. In this game, two cards are dealt to each player face down, and five community cards are placed face up in the middle of the table. Each player then takes turns betting, raising, or folding until the end of the hand.

The winning hand in Texas Hold'em is determined by the rank of the individual cards. For example, if you are dealt two aces, that would be a winning hand. If you are dealt two kings, that would also be a winning hand. There are many other hands that can beat a pair of aces, such as three of a kind or a straight flush.

In some cases, two players may have the same hand. For example, if both players have three of a kind, then the highest rank card will determine the winner. If both players have two pairs, then the player with the highest ranking pair will win. If both players have the same ranking pair, then the fifth card (the kicker) will determine the winner.

One important thing to keep in mind when playing poker is that not all hands are created equal. In some hands, you have a better chance of winning than in other hands. For example, if you are holding two queens and there are four queens on the table, then you would be considered to be "ahead" in that particular hand. On the other hand, if you were holding two deuces and there were four deuces on the table, then you would be considered to be "behind" in that particular hand.

In order to become a successful poker player, it is important to understand which hands are strong and which hands are weak. You also need to know when it is appropriate to bet and when it is appropriate to fold. If you can master these skills, then you will be able to increase your chances of winning at Unibet Poker.

#  Unibet Poker Introduces New Variant: What Beats 4 of a New Kind

Unibet Poker has just announced the addition of a new variant to its lineup: What Beats 4.

As the name suggests, in this game players battle it out to see who can be the first to collect four of a kind – not necessarily all the same rank, but four cards of the same rank.

The game is played with a 52-card deck, and the player with the highest kicker (the fifth card) takes home the pot. In case of a tie, both players split the pot evenly.

Another difference between What Beats 4 and regular poker is that there is no limit on the number of re-buys that can be made during a hand. This means that players can potentially buy back in as many times as they want until they either win or lose all their chips.

While this may seem like a risky proposition, it also opens up opportunities for big payouts if you hit that winning four of a kind.
