#  What is the gameplay like in Majestic Safari?

Majestic Safari is a wildlife simulation game for the iPhone and iPad that lets you experience the thrill of chasing down wild animals in their natural habitats. The gameplay is very realistic, and you'll need to use your wits to outsmart the animals if you want to catch them.

One of the coolest things about Majestic Safari is that it features a wide variety of animals, from lions and tigers to zebras and giraffes. You can explore different environments like the African savanna or the American prairie, and each area has its own set of animals.

The controls are simple but effective. To chase an animal, just tap on it and then hold down your finger to run after it. If you want to fire a tranquilizer dart, just tap on the animal again and then drag your finger away from it to aim. When you're close enough, release your finger to fire the dart.

It's important to be careful when chasing down animals, because they can easily outrun you if you're not careful. And if you fall too far behind, the animal will disappear into the distance and you'll have to start over again.

You can also use special abilities like roar power or speed boost to help you catch up to elusive prey. Be sure to use these abilities at the right time, or you'll end up wasting them.

Overall, Majestic Safari is a really fun game that simulates the thrill of hunting wild animals in their natural habitats. The controls are easy to learn but challenging to master, and there's a wide variety of animals to capture. If you're looking for an exciting new wildlife simulation game, Majestic Safari is definitely worth a try.
