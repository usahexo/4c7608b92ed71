#  How to Win at Blackjack - Basic Strategy & Tips from JL Bourg

One of the most popular casino games is blackjack. It's easy to learn, and there are a variety of strategies you can use to improve your odds of winning. In this article, I'll teach you the basics of blackjack strategy, as well as some tips to help you win more often.

The goal of blackjack is to accumulate cards with a value of 21 or less, without going over. The ace can be counted as 1 or 11, so a hand of Ace-2-3 would total 16. If your hand exceeds 21, you bust and lose regardless of the dealer's hand.

The first step in playing blackjack is to place a bet. You can then hit (draw another card) or stand (stick with the current total). If you hit and exceed 21, you bust and lose your bet. The dealer must stand on all 17s, and only draws cards until they reach 16 or more (in which case they must drew cards until they reach 17).

Basic Blackjack Strategy

There are a number of basic strategies you can use to improve your odds at blackjack. One strategy is to always split pairs of Aces and 8s. Another is to never split 10s or 5s. You can also double down on any two cards, as long as the total amount equals 10 or 11. Here are some more specific tips:

* When the dealer has an Ace up, hit if your total is 13 or less, otherwise stand.

* Double down on 9 if the dealer has a 3, 4, 5 or 6 up.

* Split 8s if the dealer has a 2 or 3 up.

* Split 10s only if the dealer has a card of equal value (10, Jack, Queen or King).

 Blackjack Tips & Tricks

In addition to using basic strategy, there are a few tricks you can use to increase your chances of winning at blackjack:

* Count cards - This isn't technically cheating, but it gives you an advantage over the casino. By keeping track of the high and low cards played, you can make better decisions about when to hit and stand. This technique takes practice but can be lucrative in the long run.


* Use a betting system - There are a number of different betting systems that claim to help players win more often at blackjack. One such system is called "the Martingale." With this system, players double their bets after each loss until they win one hand; at which point they start over with their original bet amount. While this system does have some success rate, it's also risky since players can quickly lose large sums of money if they keep losing hands.

Blackjack is a fun and easy game to learn that offers plenty of opportunities for strategic play. With a bit of practice and these basic tips under your belt, you'll be on your way to winning more often at the casino table!

#  Blackjack for Beginners - Learn the Rules of the Game from JL Bourg

Blackjack, also known as Twenty-One, is one of the most popular casino games in the world. The object of the game is to beat the dealer by reaching a total of 21 or as close to 21 as possible without going over. In this article, we will teach you how to play blackjack and give you some tips on how to win.

## How to Play

The basic rules of blackjack are simple. The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards, one face up and one face down. The player then has the option to either hit (take another card) or stand (stay with their current total). If the player's total exceeds 21, they bust and lose automatically. If the dealer's first card is an ace, they will offer players the option of taking insurance. Insurance is a side bet that pays 2:1 if the dealer has blackjack. If the player declines insurance, and the dealer does not have blackjack, they lose their original bet. If the player accepts insurance and the dealer has blackjack, they push (tie) and neither player nor dealer wins or loses money on that hand.

After all players have finished their turns, the dealer flips over their second card. If the dealer's total equals 16 or less, they must hit; if their total equals 17 or more, they must stand. In both cases, if they bust (go over 21), all players still in the hand automatically lose regardless of their own totals. Winning hands are paid even money unless the player has a blackjack which pays 3:2.

Here are some important tips for beginners:

* Try to get as close to 21 as possible without going over - this gives you the best chance of winning.

* Remember that if you go over 21, you automatically lose - so be careful not to hit too many times when your total is high.

* Sometimes it's sensible to stand on lower totals even if you could potentially get more points by hitting - this can minimise your chances of busting.

* Always take insurance when offered - even if you don't think the dealer has blackjack, it's still worth taking because it's such a good odds bet.

#  How to Play 21 - Tips and Strategies from JL Bourg

21 is a game that can be enjoyed by players of all ages. The object of the game is to accumulate as many points as possible by drawing and discarding cards until one player either has no cards left in their hand or reaches 21.

Below are some tips and strategies for playing 21 that will help you become a master of the game!

1. Pay attention to your hand - This may seem like common sense, but it's important to keep track of the cards that you have in your hand. This will help you make better decisions about which cards to discard and which ones to keep.

2. Keep your options open - In order to score points, you need to keep as many options available to you as possible. This means keeping deadwood (cards with no point value) to a minimum.

3. Know your limits - It's important not to go over 21, as this results in a loss of points. Decide beforehand how many points you're willing to risk in order to get the card you need.

4. Take advantage of bonuses - There are certain bonuses available in the game, such as the 10-point bonus for slapping the table or the 5-point bonus for being the first player out. Make sure you take advantage of these bonuses whenever possible!

5. Keep an eye on your opponents - It's also important to keep tabs on your opponents' hands and what cards they're discarding. This will allow you to make better decisions about which cards to keep and which ones to discard.

#  The Best Way to Play Blackjack - Advice from Professional Gambler, JL Bourg

Blackjack is one of the most popular casino games in the world. Although it may seem like a simple game to play, there are a few things that gamblers can do to increase their chances of winning. In this article, I will share some advice on how to play blackjack that has been learned from my years of experience as a professional gambler.

First and foremost, you should always try to avoid making bad bets. This means staying away from double downs and splits when you don't have a good hand. Furthermore, you should also make sure to keep track of the dealer's up card and adjust your bet size accordingly. For example, if the dealer is showing a low card (2-6), you should increase your bet size, as they are more likely to bust. Conversely, if the dealer is showing a high card (7-A), you should decrease your bet size, as the dealer is less likely to bust.

Another important thing to keep in mind when playing blackjack is that you want to get as close to 21 as possible without going over. This is known as "busting" and will result in a loss for the player. If you have a pair or two cards that are equal value (e.g. two 8s), then you can split them into two separate hands. You can also double down on your hand if you think you have a good chance of winning.

In the end, blackjack is all about making smart decisions and playing against the odds. By following the tips mentioned in this article, you can give yourself a better chance of winning at the casino table.
