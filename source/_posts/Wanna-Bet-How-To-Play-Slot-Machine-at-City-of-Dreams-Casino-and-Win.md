#  How to Play Slot Machine and Win Big at the City of Dreams Casino in Manila

If you're looking for an adrenaline rush and a chance to win big, look no further than the slot machines at City of Dreams Casino in Manila. With a range of betting options and payout rates, there's something for everyone at this casino. Read on for our tips on how to hit the jackpot playing slots at City of Dreams.

To get started, choose the right machine for you. There are three types of slot machines at City of Dreams: traditional three-reel machines with one payline, five-reel video slots with multiple paylines, and progressive jackpot machines. If you're a beginner, we recommend starting with the traditional three-reelers – they're easier to understand and have smaller minimum bets.

Once you've chosen your machine, decide how much money you want to risk. Like all casinos, City of Dreams has minimum and maximum bets – so be sure to familiarize yourself with these before you start playing. Remember that it's always better to start small and work your way up as you gain confidence – especially if this is your first time playing slots.

Next, it's time to spin the reels! To do this, just pull the handle or press the button once the reels have stopped spinning. The aim is to match symbols on the payline to win prizes. The amount you win depends on the symbol(s) matched and the size of your bet. Common symbols include fruits (cherries, lemons, plums), BARs (single, double, triple), numbers (sevens, eights), and letters (clubs, spades, hearts).

There are also special symbols that can help you win bigger prizes: Wilds (represented by a logo) substitute for any other symbol to create winning combinations; Scatters (a star) activate free spins; and progressives (a wheel) award random cash prizes ranging from a few hundred dollars up to millions of pesos.

Once you've won a prize, it's time to collect your reward! Just head over to one of the casino's many Cashiers cages and present your ticket(s) for redemption. Remember that not all machines payout in cash – some give out vouchers which can be redeemed for goods or services at participating outlets within City of Dreams.

So what are you waiting for? Get yourself down to City of Dreams Casino in Manila today and see if lady luck is on your side!
