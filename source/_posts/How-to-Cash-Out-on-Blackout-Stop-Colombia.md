#  How to Cash Out on Blackout Stop Colombia

"The only way to stop a thief is with a bigger thief."

-Russian proverb

In May of 2018, the Colombian government passed a law that would allow for the seizure of cryptocurrencies from individuals and businesses in order to combat money laundering. The new bill, known as "Decree No. 3398", gives financial intelligence unit Fernando Aristeguieta broad authority to investigate and freeze assets related to criminal activity.1

The bill has caused great concern among cryptocurrency investors and businesses operating in Colombia, as it could lead to widespread asset seizures and disrupt the country's thriving crypto-economy.2 Many investors are now looking for ways to cash out their holdings before the law goes into effect on July 20th.3

Fortunately, there are a number of methods investors can use to convert their cryptocurrencies into fiat currency without having to go through traditional exchanges.
